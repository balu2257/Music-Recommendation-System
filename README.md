# Music-Recommendation-System
# Objective:
The goal was to create a system that can recommend personalized music tracks to users based on their listening history and preferences. The system was designed to incorporate both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide accurate and relevant music recommendations.
# Model Implementation:
I implemented a hybrid recommendation model that combines both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. The collaborative filtering part of the model utilizes user-item interaction data to find similarities between users and recommend tracks based on the preferences of similar users. The content-based filtering model analyzes the attributes of the tracks (e.g., genre, artist, tempo) to recommend similar tracks based on user preferences.
# Datasets: 
The dataset consisted of a large collection of user listening histories, including information on user IDs, track IDs, and track attributes. The data was pre-processed and split into training and test sets. Key features included user ratings, track metadata (e.g., genre, artist, tempo), and user demographic information.
# Training of Model: 
The model was trained on the pre-processed dataset using the following configuration:
Training Data: 80% of the dataset was used for training.
Collaborative Filtering: Implemented using matrix factorization and the Surprise library.
Content-Based Filtering: Features were extracted from track metadata, and cosine similarity was used to calculate similarity between tracks.
Hybrid Approach: A weighted sum of collaborative and content-based filtering scores was used to generate final recommendations.
Fine-Tuning: The model was fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques like Grid Search to achieve better accuracy.
# Model Testing: 
The model was tested on a completely unseen test dataset to evaluate its robustness and ability to generalize to new data. The test results were consistent with the validation results, although slightly lower in terms of accuracy, indicating the model's potential to generalize well but also highlighting areas for improvement, such as handling cold-start users (new users with limited interaction data).
# Conclusion: 
The Music Recommendation System was successfully implemented, combining both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. The model demonstrated strong performance in recommending relevant tracks to users based on their preferences. While the model performed well in both validation and testing, there is an opportunity to improve the handling of cold-start problems and enhance the recommendation of less popular tracks. Further fine-tuning and potential incorporation of deep learning techniques could also enhance the system's overall performance.
